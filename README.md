## Full Stack Developer Portfolio
This is a sample README file for a full stack developer portfolio. The portfolio showcases four projects: a calculator, pastel puzzle, run buddy, and LED wall.

## Projects

### 1. Calculator 
The calculator project is a web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers and operators. Users can input numbers and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 2. Pastel Puzzle
The pastel puzzle project is a fun and interactive game built with React. It challenges users to solve a puzzle by rearranging pastel-colored tiles. The game features different levels of difficulty and a timer to track the user's progress. The pastel puzzle project demonstrates the use of React components, state management, and event handling.

### 3. Run Buddy
Run Buddy is a fitness website developed using HTML and CSS. It provides information about personal training services and allows users to sign up for training sessions. The website includes sections for services offered, testimonials from satisfied clients, and a contact form for inquiries. The Run Buddy project showcases responsive design principles and the use of CSS frameworks.

### 4. LED Wall
The LED wall project is a unique installation that combines hardware and software. It features a wall of programmable LED lights controlled by a web application. Users can customize the LED patterns and colors using the web interface. The LED wall project demonstrates the integration of front-end development with hardware components, such as Arduino boards and LED strips.
